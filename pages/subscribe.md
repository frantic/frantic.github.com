## RSS

This blog delivers updates via [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). To use it, you need _a reader_.

1. Register at one of the services or install an app. Good list of hosted RSS readers and apps can be found [here](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/).
2. Add my blog to the sources. Usually "`frantic.im`" would work, but if it doesnâ€™t, try this: "`http://frantic.im/feed.xml`"
3. Enjoy!

## Twitter

You might follow [@alex_frantic](https://twitter.com/alex_frantic) on Twitter, everything I write I announce on Twitter as well.
