    I'm writing an in-depth book about React Native. It contains everything you need to know â€“
    from the overview of the JavaScript ecosystem, to ideas behind React, specifics of building
    and shipping mobile apps.

    The frontend landscape changes every day. This book is designed around the important core
    ideas that <em>don't</em> change.
  </p>
  <p>
    I worked on React Native core team from the framework's earliest days. I also built
    a bunch of apps at Facebook, one of them is the official <a href="https://www.fbf8.com/">F8 conference</a> app (<a href="https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app">open sourced in 2016</a>). I
    hope my experience will help you better understand React Native and ship successful apps.
